The Loom is an interface to a base model. Instead of acting as an assistant, it generates completions from input. Assistants have mode collapsed into one persona, but base models are capable of much more interesting and varied output.

Very short prompts - a few words or several characters - often produce more diverse and interesting results than longer, more structured prompts. While longer prompts can guide the completions in specific directions, minimal prompts give the model more freedom to explore different possibilities and patterns. This can lead to surprising and creative outputs that might not emerge from more constrained prompts.

The Loom can occasionally misinterpret minimal prompts as the beginning of a file named 'untitled.txt'. This is a bug.
